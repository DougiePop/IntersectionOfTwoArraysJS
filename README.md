# IntersectionOfTwoArraysJS

Written in Javascript

Different ways to solve this problem, but I used the binary search method which incorporates recursion which is the solution I would be looking for if I was an interviewer.

Problem:

Given two arrays of numbers, nums1 & nums2, return a new array that contains elements that exists in both nums1 & nums2. If there are more than one instances of the same element in both nums1 & nums2, then the returning array must contain the same number of instances.
